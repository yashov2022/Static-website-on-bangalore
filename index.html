                <h2>History of Bangalore</h2>
                <p>
                    Bangalore, officially known as Bengaluru, is the capital city of Karnataka. Its roots date back to
                    1537 when Kempe Gowda, a Vijayanagara feudal lord, founded the city. He envisioned it as a town
                    fortified with walls, watchtowers, and gates, setting the foundation for its growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the 18th century, Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan transformed Bangalore into a strategic
                    center for administration and military operations. Tipu Sultan's resistance to British colonial
                    expansion earned the city a place in India's freedom struggle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1799, after Tipu Sultan's defeat, Bangalore came under British control and soon emerged as an
                    administrative and military hub. The British also contributed significantly to its infrastructure,
                    including the introduction of railways and public services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore evolved into a center of innovation, education,
                    and technology. Today, it is celebrated as the "Silicon Valley of India," hosting numerous IT
                    companies, startups, and research institutions.
